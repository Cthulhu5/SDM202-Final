This is a modified robot chassis control code based on RTS-Firmware-ICRA2020,
The modifications are as follows:
  - Modified the mapping of remote control channel S1 (chassis_task.c)
    a) Modified chassis motor control mapping when S1=1 (up) : 
      wz (spin) speed factor: 0.0 -> 1.0;
    b) Modified chassis motor control mapping when S1=3 (mid) : 
      vx (forward) speed factor: 1.0 -> 0.2;
      vy (side) speed factor: 1.0 -> 0.2;
      wz (spin) speed factor: 1.0 -> 0.5;
  - Modified the mapping of remote control channel S2 (chassis_task.c)
    a) Modified control mapping when S2: 1 (up) -> 3 (mid) :
      Update position status for GM6020: 1 (up) -> 3 (mid)
    b) Modified control mapping when S2: 3 (mid) -> 1 (up) :
      Update position status for GM6020: 3 (mid) -> 1 (up)
  - Modified the method: int32_t chassis_angle_broadcast(int16_t yaw, int16_t rev) (chassis_task.c)
      Instead of sending chassis attitude data to the cradle head, the GM6020 control code is sent.

  - Fixed an issue that caused the program to not work properly by pulling out the jumper cap by mistake:
      Modified init.c to remove the judgment about chassis development board/pan-head development board and force the lock to be chassis development board
